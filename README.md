# Data-Analysis-with-Python
Python packages are a powerful programming language for data analysis, enabling integration with web apps and statistics code in production databases. Despite their infancy, Python has improved significantly over the years, offering tools like NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation and graphics creation.

Course Outline
INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON AND BASIC STATISTICS

Course Description

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. You can use Python when your data analysis tasks need to be integrated with web apps or if statistics code needs to be incorporated into a production database. Being a full-fledged programming language, it’s a great tool to implement algorithms for production use.

While the infancy of Python packages for data analysis was an issue in the past, this has improved significantly over the years.
